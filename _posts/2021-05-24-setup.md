We were finally able to get the drone up and running! I'll quickly note down
what I was needed to get the drone running below.

1. Change the ``settings.json`` file in ``~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json``.
   This specific location is for my computer (I run pop!OS), but I'm fairly
   confident that you'll find it in your ``Documents`` folder as well. Anyways,
   change the file to look like this:

   ```
  {
  "SeeDocsAt": "https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/settings.md",
  "SettingsVersion": 1.2,
  "SimMode": "Multirotor",
  "ViewMode": "SpringArmChase",
  "ClockSpeed": 1.0,
  "PawnPaths": {
    "DefaultQuadrotor": { "PawnBP": "Class'/AirSim/Blueprints/BP_FlyingPawn.BP_FlyingPawn_C'"  }
  },
  "Vehicles": {
    "SimpleFlight": {
      "VehicleType": "SimpleFlight",
      "DefaultVehicleState": "Armed",
      "EnableCollisionPassthrogh": false,
      "EnableCollisions": true,
      "AllowAPIAlways": true,
      "RC": {
        "RemoteControlID": 0,
        "AllowAPIWhenDisconnected": false
      }
    }
  }
} 
   ```
   This will make it so that the binaries will automatically load with the
   drone, and the script we're about to include will work with the drone API.

2. Setting up the actual code to run. To save some time, I would recommend
   cloning our [repository](https://github.com/AISUM-Purdue/testing) and then running the following commands
   ```
   source ./bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   You should now have all the dependencies ready to go.

3. Test the code! Load up the airsim binaries you want to use and once the
   simulation is loaded, run ``python hello_drone.py`` (make sure you are in
   the correct virtual environment) and done! The drone
   should be ready to fly.
